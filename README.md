# My First Simple API From Uni

This is a simple api created to do get, post, put and delete.

Shown in an image is how the api could be used using postman.

### *Notes:
- This project only has 1 commit as was added later for the purpose of demonstration of what I have done.
- In db.js the connections to the database have been removed.
